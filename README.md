# MatlabCourse
Course taught to rising second-year Econ PhD students about computational methods in Matlab.

This repository contains materials from two separate three-week mini-courses on Matlab. Materials are dividing in the following way:

## Syllabus (1 and 2)
Syllabi for each mini-course are labeled in sequence (1 or 2) and available in the main directory. Lecture Notes and Problem Sets proceed from the course outline in each syllabus.

## Lecture Notes (1 and 2)
Lecture Notes materials (.tex and .pdf files, as well as in-class examples in .m files) are categorized into "1" or "2" corresponding to in which mini-course they were presented. 

## Problem Sets (1 and 2)
Likewise, Problem Sets are located in the appropriate mini-course folders. Each problem set has its own subfolder which houses the problem set document, exemplary write-up, and code files used to complete the problem set.
