\title{Problem Set 3}

\maketitle
Directions: Answer all questions. Clearly label all answers. Show
all of your code. Turn in the following to me via your dropbox (in
a folder labeled 'MatlabPS1.3') in Sakai by 11:59 p.m. on Thursday,
July 19, 2012: 
\begin{itemize}
\item m-file(s)
\item a log file (from off the cluster)
\item matsub.oXXXXX file
\item pdf version of your writeup with its \LaTeX source code
\end{itemize}
Put the names of all group members at the top of your writeup (each
student must turn in his/her own materials).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Practice with Matlab's graphics using \texttt{nhanes2d.mat} (from
PS2) --- visualizing descriptive evidence

\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate a kernel density plot of the variable \texttt{hct}. How {}``normal''
does the variable look? Be sure to add axis labels and a title to
your graph.
\item Now generate a histogram of \texttt{hct} with a normal pdf overlaying
it. Again, label axes and assign a title appropriately. Do you think
\texttt{hct} still looks {}``normal''? 
\item On the same figure, plot the empirical cdf of \texttt{hct} by gender.
Plot males and females with different line styles and include a legend.
Does one gender stochastically dominate another?
\item Now repeat (c) but break out the distribution by region instead of
gender. 
\item Now repeat (c) but break out the distribution by race instead of gender.
\end{enumerate}
\item Viewing model fit graphically

\begin{enumerate}
\item Graphing a predicted OLS plane

\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate the following model (from question 2(a) of Problem Set 2):
\begin{eqnarray}
hct_{i} & = & \beta_{1}+\beta_{2}age_{i}+\beta_{3}black_{i}+\beta_{4}other_{i}+\beta_{5}heartatk_{i}+\nonumber \\
 &  & \beta_{6}female_{i}+\beta_{7}highbp_{i}+\beta_{8}northeast_{i}+\beta_{9}midwest_{i}+\nonumber \\
 &  & \beta_{10}south_{i}+\beta_{11}non\_central\_city_{i}+\beta_{12}rural_{i}+\beta_{13}height_{i}+\\
 &  & \beta_{14}weight_{i}+\beta_{15}houssiz_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
\emph{Be sure to drop observations for all variables where any of
the variables are missing. Also, report the sum of squared residuals
and/or log likelihood at convergence, number of iterations to convergence,
and the estimation sample size.}\\
\\
Use \texttt{ezsurf} to graph the {}``marginal'' OLS plane for the
intercept and the variables \texttt{height} and \texttt{weight}. Display
the graph over the bounds $\left[\min\left(height\right),\max\left(height\right)\right]\times\left[\min\left(weight\right),\max\left(weight\right)\right]$.
Correctly label all axes, and title your graph appropriately.
\end{enumerate}
\item Graphing actual data vs predicted OLS plane

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add actual data points to your graph in part (i) of question (a).
Make sure your dimensions are correctly lined up. How well do height
and weight jointly predict hematocrit percentage (conditional on all
other covariates in the OLS data matrix)? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Maximum likelihood estimation for a discrete dependent variable (high
blood pressure)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Using \texttt{fminunc} (with convergence tolerances at $10^{-8}$),
estimate the following model:
\begin{eqnarray}
highbp_{i} & = & \beta_{1}+\beta_{2}age_{i}+\beta_{3}black_{i}+\beta_{4}other_{i}+\beta_{5}heartatk_{i}+\nonumber \\
 &  & \beta_{6}female_{i}+\beta_{7}hct_{i}+\beta_{8}northeast_{i}+\beta_{9}midwest_{i}+\nonumber \\
 &  & \beta_{10}south_{i}+\beta_{11}non\_central\_city_{i}+\beta_{12}rural_{i}+\beta_{13}height_{i}+\\
 &  & \beta_{14}weight_{i}+\beta_{15}houssiz_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
assuming $\varepsilon_{i}\sim$logistic. For this problem, the log
likelihood looks like
\[
\ell\left(X_{i};\beta\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left\{ 1\left[highbp_{i}=1\right]\ln\left(P_{i}\right)+1\left[highbp_{i}=0\right]\ln\left(1-P_{i}\right)\right\} 
\]
where $1\left[highbp_{i}=1\right]$ is a dummy for whether or not
$highbp_{i}$ is 1, and
\[
P_{i}=\frac{\exp\left(X_{i}\beta\right)}{1+\exp\left(X_{i}\beta\right)}.
\]
\emph{Be sure to drop observations for all variables where any of
the variables are missing. Also, report the standard errors of $\hat{\beta}$,
the log likelihood at convergence, number of iterations to convergence,
and the estimation sample size.}
\item Repeat (a), but now assume that $\varepsilon_{i}\sim N\left(0,1\right)$
(i.e., estimate the probit model). In this case, the log likelihood
is the same as in (a), but with
\[
P_{i}=\Phi\left(X_{i}\beta\right),
\]
where $\Phi$ is the CDF of the standard normal distribution. \textbf{}\\
\textbf{}\\
\textbf{Note:} If you're like me and have trouble getting your probit
likelihood to converge, try estimating it first with \texttt{fminsearch}
(starting from your logit answers), then with \texttt{fminunc} (starting
from where \texttt{fminsearch} ended). If this is still problematic,
consider modifying your likelihood function so that Matlab doesn't
attempt to evaluate the log of 0. This can be done, e.g., by setting
$P_{i}=10^{-200}$ if $P_{i}=0$.
\item Divide your logit $\hat{\beta}$ estimates by 1.6 and compare with
your probit $\hat{\beta}$ estimates. How different are the two vectors?
Briefly discuss some of the main results from this estimation.
\item Compare the fit of the models estimated in (a) and (b) in two ways:
\emph{(i)} compare the average of $highbp$ with the average $\hat{P}_{logit}$
and $\hat{P}_{probit}$%
\footnote{$\hat{P}_{i}=f\left(X_{i}\hat{\beta}\right)$%
}; \emph{(ii)} compare the maximum likelihood values. Which model does
better at fitting the average probability? Which model has a higher
likelihood value?\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
