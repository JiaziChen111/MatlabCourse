\title{Problem Set 3 Solutions}


\author{Tyler Ransom}

\maketitle
Directions: Answer all questions. Clearly label all answers. Show
all of your code. Compute standard errors for all parameter estimates.
Turn in the following to me via your dropbox (in a folder labeled
'MatlabPS2.3') in Sakai by 11:59 p.m. on Thursday, August 9, 2012: 
\begin{itemize}
\item m-file(s)
\item .sh shell script file that executes your m-file(s)%
\footnote{Name your job something other than {}``matsub,'' and have it send
you an email upon completion.%
}
\item a log file (from off the cluster)
\item shell\_name.oXXXXX file
\item pdf version of your writeup with its \LaTeX source code
\end{itemize}
Put the names of all group members at the top of your writeup (each
student must turn in his/her own materials). As usual, set the seed
for \texttt{rand} and \texttt{randn} to 1234.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simulation of a definite integral with no closed form. In this question,
compute the integral of $f\left(x\right)$ from $-10$ to $1$, where
$f\left(x\right)=\exp\left(-x^{2}\right)$. This integral has no closed
form solution, so we will approximate its value by two methods:

\begin{enumerate}
\item With quadrature, the integral computes to 1.6331
\item See my m-code and Table 1 for complete solution. To get close to the
quadrature solution, I had to do 2 million draws. The quadrature time
was .046 seconds. The simulation time with 20 million draws was 2.737
seconds. Surprisingly, the results with 2 million draws performed
better than with 20 million.
\end{enumerate}
\item Bootstrapping, using the dataset \texttt{nlsw88.mat}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The bootstrapped sample mean of \texttt{ttl\_exp} is 12.5374 with
standard error of .0968. The mean taken from the data is 12.5350 with
standard error of .0973. In this case, the bootstrapping slightly
overestimates the mean, and slightly underestimates the standard error.
\item The boostramped sample median of ln(wage) is 1.8384 with standard
error of .0150. The population analogs are 1.8361 and .0152. Again,
the bootstrapping slightly overstaded the median and slightly understated
the dispersion.
\item See Table 2 for the comparison between bootstrap and regular OLS.
The results are exactly the same for the coefficients, but that's
because this wasn't a full bootstrap (since I followed the example
in \texttt{bootstrp}, which only bootstrapped the standard errors
and not the coefficients). The standard errors are no more than .0006
different, which makes sense. We shouldn't expect any difference,
because the OLS standard errors are the true standard errors. In most
applications of the bootstrap, there's something about the estimation
method that prevents recovery of the correct standard errors, so bootstrapping
is used as a way of recovering them.
\item See Table 3 for the comparison between bootstrap and regular OLS.
The standard errors are exactly the same, regardless of which bootstrap
method was employed. The coefficients were off by as much as .026,
but the differences are proportional to the standard errors of the
estimates, which makes sense.
\end{enumerate}
\item Examining heterogeneity methods in a binomial probit model. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item See Table 4 for a comparison of (a), (b), and (c)
\item See Table 4 for full details. $\hat{\pi}=.7334.$ This is interpreted
as the proportion of people with $\alpha_{i}=1$. This can also be
estimated as a type-specific intercept, where the coefficient on the
intercept is constrained to $1$. 
\item See Table 4 for full details. I used a step size of .03 for my grid.
Comparing the three estimation results, the slope parameters are much
more similar between the random effects specifications than the no-heterogeneity
specification. Across the board, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity
amplifies the estimates for each of the slope parameters. The finite
mixture specification has a higher log likelihood than the continuous
random effects specification. However, it is unclear which random
effects specification should be preferred.
\end{enumerate}
